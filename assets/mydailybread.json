This night will they require thy soul of thee!\" He died that night, unprepared to face his judge. Let me always face life's greatest fact-I live for Heaven or for hell. My earthly life will show what choice I make. My God, give me the strength to live a holy life on earth so that I may receive the eternal reward of Heavenly life with You. Amen.CONVERSIONThe Four Last ThingsFEW THINGS in this earthly life are absolutely certain. The most undebatable of these is death. Every man, even the atheist, will admit this much. Death, however, is not the very last event in this life of ours. Right after death, we shall be judged. Our private judgment will be repeated on the Day of judgment, when all men will know us for what we are.Our judgment will depend on how we live this earthly life of ours. If we have honestly done our best and followed the commandments of Christ, we shall be rewarded with the perfect life of Heaven. If, however, we have disregarded His loving directions and refused to make use of His generous help, we shall be condemned to hell.Death, judgment, Heaven, and hell-these are the four last things toward which we are moving each hour of the day and night. They will never frighten us if our conscience is clear. If we love God in our daily life, that is, if we are sincerely trying to know and follow His holy Will, we have no reason to fear.By keeping this eternal goal ever before us, we shall think straight when life's problems and difficulties face us. In making the following meditations, we must strive to become eternity-minded. We must seek to guarantee to ourselves, as far as is in our power, the unending success and unmarred happiness of Heaven.CONVERSIONCHAPTER 13"

Each day you will learn more about yourself, even things which you do not now suspect.2. Every man is something of a mystery to himself. In every human heart there is plenty of room for self-deception. The intention which you claim, may not be the real reason which moves you. Deep within you there may be other reasons, selfish, worldly reasons. Because of this truth I want you to develop a healthy Self distrust and a supernatural trust in My help. No matter how holy you may feel, never trust yourself too far. Refuse to rely on yourself alone. Without Me you are nothing, and without My help, you can do nothing worthy of Heaven.3. Your first reaction to this truth might be to worry about your salvation. I have no desire to alarm you, nor do I wish to make you an abnormal self-centered person. I simply want you to live according to the truth. I did not die on the cross that you might be lost, but that you might gain Heaven. You must do your part in this plan. Make a sincere intention to obey My commandments in your daily life. Prove your sincerity by an honest daily effort. In any doubt consult My Church for direction. After you have done all this, place all your hope and confidence in My love and mercy.4. My saints were truly wise in their suspicion of self. Realizing that eternity awaited them in Heaven or hell, they were determined to take no chances with self-deception. They overcame it by a holy self-contempt and selfdistrust. They did this in an intelligent way. They fixed their eye on My boundless perfection, the passing nature of earthly life, and the folly of losing Heaven's eternal joy and glory. This vision convinced them that I deserved the best from them, and that their best was all too little for Me. They made doubly sure of their unselfishness with Me by avoiding many things which self desired and by embracing many things which self disliked.5. Even while practicing all this self-denial, they continued to pray that no self-deception might remain in their souls. They made frequent acts of hope, that their good works, penances, and prayers might be acceptable to Me.

In following self, I shall lose You. 0 let me make efforts to be sure that self shall never control me. I want to practice more prayer, unselfishness, and self-denial in my daily activities.

By working to form good habits, we will slowly replace bad ones. God's help will not be wanting.Just how sincere we are when we say that we love Christ, is seen in our daily effort for perfection. God will not judge us by our failures, but rather, by our efforts. He wants us to try, and to keep trying, to become the kind of person He wants us to be. Over-confidence shows our pride and presumption. Discouragement in time of failure, shows selfishness. Only a humble, determined, and persevering effort can prove genuine love for Christ.This part deals only with the outstanding habits which keep men from a full generosity with God.

              "2. True, there are times when light conversation brings needed relief and necessary recreation, but talk which does not help the speaker or the listener to live a better life, is a shameful waste of precious time, time which will never return.",

              "4. Many saints have avoided the company of men whenever possible in order to enjoy a closer union with Me. One of them once remarked: \"As often as I have gone among men, I returned less a man.\" Isn't this true of you when you talk too long? It is easier to keep silence altogether than to stop talking when you should.",
              "5. In silence I shall speak to you with less interruptions. My words will come in the form of ideas, desires, intentions, and resolutions which arise within your soul. You will hear My voice with less distraction. Love silence and learn to use it well. Then will you draw closer to Me, as I am close to you."

            "Think": "Silence is truly a virtue when practiced for God. In developing a love for silence, I will learn a deeper wisdom, a broader outlook on everyday life, and a brighter vision of God's nearness and love. In human conversations, I will listen more and talk less, I will learn more and make fewer mistakes. People will respect my judgments more because I will think before speaking. Each time I open my mouth, I will do so for a definite purpose, a good purpose. God's wisdom will take the place of my human folly, and my words will help those who hear me.",
            "Pray": "Dear Holy Spirit, my God, teach me to talk well and wisely. Let me avoid useless conversations. Help me to speak often for You. Grant that my words may never hurt men of good will. May my words always bring consolation to those in sorrow, guidance to those who are confused, light to the ignorant, hope to those who despair, comfort to those who are troubled, and good advice to those in need. Take my lips and make them Yours. Take possession of my mind and make it an instrument of Your goodness and a channel of Your truth. I hope to become a man of silence, that is, one who prefers to talk to God rather than to men. In my human conversations, may I always bring You closer to them and them closer to You. Amen.BOOK TWO"

    "Description": "THIS IS THE SECOND STAGE in one's spiritual development. In abandoning his serious faults and his predominant venial sins, the spiritual beginner has laid a solid foundation of many virtues. In a sense, however, his spiritual growth thus far has been a negative sort of thing; that is, he has advanced in the various virtues by resisting the faults to which they were opposed.Christ's follower is now invited to rise to a higher degree of union with God. He is to do this by imitating the example which Christ set in His earthly life. Jesus said, \"He that sees Me, sees the Father also.\" Therefore, the more Christ-like one becomes in his daily life, the more God-like will he be. This second level of the supernatural life is known as the illuminative way, the way of enlightenment. By drawing closer to Christ in friendship, man comes to understand God more clearly and appreciate Him more fully. Jesus said, \"I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life ... Learn of Me ... \" Christ's follower must now take his eyes away from himself for longer periods, so that he may concentrate more and more upon his King and Model. He no longer practices the various virtues of daily life to oppose his faults, but to show Christ a greater love and loyalty. FOLLOWING JESUS IN DAILY LIFE ",

One who seeks this perfection, strives to live more fully for God by a greater imitation of Christ's earthly example.

The more selflessly I embrace my daily crosses, the more shall I find in them wisdom, understanding, love, and supernatural strength. I shall see through the emptiness of earthly satisfactions and pretense. My self-sacrifices will bring me a firmer love for Jesus, and I shall gradually find it easier to suffer my daily trials for His sake.

In Your suffering I shall learn how I, too, should embrace my daily crosses, in order to make reparation for my sins, become more fit for higher graces, and offer to You a love purified of selfishness and self-consideration. You deserve such devotion from me. True, my human nature shudders at the thought of suffering any insults, criticisms, mockery, failures, disappointments, and pain. With the higher wisdom and strength which I shall gain through my present crosses, I shall prepare myself for still greater ones. You alone can perform this glorious change within me. I hope for it, with the help of Your holy grace. Amen.FOLLOWING JESUS IN DAILY LIFECHAPTER 20"

I must not be content with eliminating mortal sins from my life. I am not to be satisfied even when I have eliminated the deliberate venial sins over which I have full control.

He wishes to enjoy his earthly life as far as he can without endangering his eternal salvation.",

This last group are choosing Me by turning away from every earthly satisfaction.",

Before they did so for the legitimate pleasure and enjoyment which they received from these things. Now, however, they take these things from a sense of duty to Me, because I want them to do whatever is necessary for a good day's work. These are the men who have succeeded in choosing Me in preference to all things. They are not content with giving Me glory in their life, but they seek to give Me the highest degree of glory possible.",

Without pretence and without seeking to be noticed, let me offer You as many of my natural pleasures and satisfactions as I am able. With balanced judgment and good taste, help me prefer Your company to all other company whenever I may do so.

If He had meant those words in some symbolic or figurative way, surely He would not have permitted those loved ones to leave Him. He would have kept them with Him by simply explaining His words.

All that I need is to present myself before Him, talking if I so wish, listening if I am so disposed, or simply staying with Him. He is more interested in me than anyone else. Though I may feel very dull, He is interested in my thoughts, my desires, my needs, hopes, ambitions, efforts, and labors. My daily life is a matter of the highest importance to Him. He is glad to see me come because each visit gives Him another excuse to grant me more blessings. He is there for love of me. I ought to visit Him often for love of Him.",

You deserve far more attention than I have shown You. How often could I come to You with a slight effort or even inconvenience to myself! Yet, I fail to do so.I do not treat my human friends half so neglectfully as I treat You. This sacrament is a living proof of Your love for me. I hope to show my love for You by a greater devotion toward You from now on. You will see me more than just once a week. As often as I am reasonably able, I shall visit You.

It means that you will try to direct your thoughts, desires, and actions as I desire. It means that you will never deliberately contradict My Will in any detail.",
              "2. Self-oblation necessarily involves the offering of whatever you possess, whether it be talent, occupation, opportunities, friends, and everything else. True, such an offering does not necessarily mean that you are to deprive yourself of these things. It usually means that you will now deal with them and use them only to please Me.",
              "3. Everyone is obliged to abandon whatever leads him into sin. However, the man who makes an act of self-oblation aims higher than simply avoiding sin. He seeks to please Me in a positive way, by practicing as many virtues as he can in his daily life. In his desire to belong more surely to Me, he tries to use things more from necessity than for personal satisfaction. In order to avoid all self-deceit, he would rather have less than more of this world's good things, he prefers to obey rather than command, he would sooner follow than lead.",
              "4. In all of these desires and efforts my loyal followers desire only My greater glory. They are ready to change any of their plans or intentions, if I should so wish. In their self-oblation they are no longer interested in acquiring anything for their own honor or earthly satisfaction. Their main purpose in life is to please and honor Me. They strive to center their life around Me. Many more people would reach this high level of perfection if only they would pause long enough to think of it, desire it, and try to reach it."

Yet this high level of perfection would actually lead them to true interior liberty and perfect peace of soul. In seeking to follow God's holy Will more perfectly, I am following my own highest good, my greatest perfection, my most enduring peace and happiness. Only in self-oblation am I living my daily life most fully, most intelligently, and most profitably. I shall have the highest purpose possible to man, to give eternal praise to God and to obtain eternal life with Him. This is the purpose for which God Himself made me. Can I aim at anything less?",

I ought to offer myself to You because You own all that I am and have. Jesus, Your divine Son, has given me a perfect example of self-oblation in delivering Himself up as a victim for my sins. Every thought, word, and deed of His, from the crib to the cross, was offered to You for my sake. Can I hesitate to return such generous love in my own small way? Even today I can see the self-oblation of Jesus in every Mass and in every tabernacle, where He resides in the Blessed Sacrament. He is there for love of me. What shall I do to repay such unbounded love? Grant me the courage to make my daily life a self-oblation. I hope in You for the strength to continue this effort all of ray life.

You should be devoted to Me in the Mass, because in the Mass I show once again My devotedness to you.",

In your disappointments, difficulties, fears, failures, efforts, and labors, you will unite your will to Mine.

In fact, since these are all reflections of God's goodness, they should be loved and desired. I do wrong, however, when I love any person or desire any thing more than they deserve. This happens whenever I am ready to sin for their sake. At such times I prefer these creatures to God. My dealings with all persons and things should be reasonable and sinless. God wants me to live an orderly life, placing first things first. Only then can I say that I love Him above all creatures.",

They attract me because they reflect some perfection of Yours. However, they are imperfect reflections, and they are not always as good for me as they seem. Help me to please You by using these things or abstaining from them, according as they deserve. Whatever brings disorder into my life, is bad for me. Whatever makes me more pleasing to You, is good for me. I sincerely desire to love You above all things created. I hope to do this by pleasing You every hour of the day. No person nor created thing shall ever again induce me to sin. I shall strive to be more like Jesus in my use of creatures. Amen.UNION THROUGHOUT THE DAYCHAPTER 22"
